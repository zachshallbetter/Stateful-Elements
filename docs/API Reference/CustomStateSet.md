# CustomStateSet

The `CustomStateSet` API provides a set-like object for managing custom states associated with DOM elements. It includes methods such as `add`, `delete`, and `has` for manipulating custom states.

### Methods

- `add(stateName)`: Adds the specified custom state to the set.
- `delete(stateName)`: Removes the specified custom state from the set.
- `has(stateName)`: Returns a boolean indicating whether the set contains the specified custom state.

### Examples of Use

```jsx
// Creating a new CustomStateSet
const customStates = new CustomStateSet();

// Adding custom states to the set
customStates.add('active');
customStates.add('disabled');

// Checking if a state exists in the set
console.log(customStates.has('active')); // Output: true
console.log(customStates.has('hidden')); // Output: false

// Removing a state from the set
customStates.delete('disabled');
console.log(customStates.has('disabled')); // Output: false

```

In this example, a new `CustomStateSet` object is created and populated with custom states using the `add` method. The `has` method is then used to check if specific states exist in the set, and the `delete` method removes a state from the set when necessary.

### Handling Fallbacks for Unsupported Browsers

To ensure compatibility with browsers that do not support the `CustomStateSet` API, consider the following strategies:

### Feature Detection

Utilize feature detection techniques to check if the browser supports the `CustomStateSet` API. If it does, use it to its full extent. Otherwise, fallback to alternative state management techniques that are supported by the browser.

### Polyfills

Consider using polyfills to replicate the functionality of the `CustomStateSet` API in browsers that do not support it natively. Polyfills are JavaScript code that implements missing web standards, allowing older browsers to use modern features. There are several polyfills available for web APIs, including custom element polyfills that provide support for features like `CustomStateSet`.

### Progressive Enhancement

Design your application with progressive enhancement in mind. Start with a basic, functional version of your application that relies on standard web technologies supported by all browsers. Then, enhance the user experience for modern browsers by adding features like the `CustomStateSet` API where supported.

### Graceful Degradation

Alternatively, follow a graceful degradation approach, where you build your application with the latest features and then provide fallbacks for unsupported browsers. This ensures that users with older browsers can still access your application, albeit with reduced functionality.
